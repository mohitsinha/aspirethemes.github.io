### Translation

Bold theme is full ready to be translated into other languages and could be easily translated with [poedit.net](https://poedit.net/) application.

The theme contains the main translation file `bold.pot` inside the languages directory which will be used by poedit application.

Here are simple steps:

1. Install poedit and open it.
2. Once the app is opened click Create new translation.
3. Choose the `bold.pot` file inside the theme `bold/language` directory.
4. Once the translation is done, save the file according to your language code. Find a list of language codes at [WordPress in your Language](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/teams/). As an example, the language code for English (UK) is `en_GB`, so you will end up with two new files: `en_GB.po` and then `en_GB.mo`.
5. When that’s done, simply upload the files to `bold/language` folder using FTP.
6. Change the site language by going to `WordPress > General > Settings` and choose the target language from `Site Language` drop-down menu.

### Theme Development

If you are a developer and need to do customization work, the theme is using [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) to compile [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) and JavaScript. This improves the development flow and making it much faster.

First, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), and [Bower](https://bower.io/#install-bower) installed, then run the-the following commands in the theme root directory to install *npm* and *bower* dependencies.

{% highlight shell %}
npm install
{% endhighlight %}

To start Gulp, run:

{% highlight shell %}
gulp
{% endhighlight %}

This will compile Sass and JavaScript files, and start watching changes as you edit files.
