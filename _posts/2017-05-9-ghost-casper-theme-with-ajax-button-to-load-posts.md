Recently, I released the [Bold](https://themeforest.net/item/bold-blog-and-magazine-clean-ghost-theme/19663870) Ghost theme with a new feature to load new posts with AJAX button, which makes it very easy to load posts instantly without going to another page.

I thought this would be great to share the feature and integrate it with the default theme for the Ghost platform which I think will be helpful for anyone who is using the default theme and would like to have this feature.
